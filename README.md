# README

This app is meant to play with both the comparable module and ruby's dry monads.

The idea is that a spoiled child has asked for a new dog for christmas. (She already has a dog) But she wants a new one and has an intricate grading system to decide if her new dog is better than the one she already has.

The new dog must be
- cuter (obviously)
- have the ability to play fetch
- shorthaired
- brown with white spots
