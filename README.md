This app is meant to play with the dry monad gem.

The idea is that a spoiled child has asked for a new dog for christmas. (She already has a dog) But she wants a new one and has an intricate grading system to decide if her new dog is better than the one she already has.

The new dog must be
- cuter (obviously)
- have the ability to play fetch
- shorthaired
- brown with white spots

If the dog fulfills every one of the girls wishes then you are the best dad ever!
Otherwise this spoiled child throws a fit ðŸ˜­

I wrote a few specs but it's not really built out.

There is no UI for this, really just playing with a gem on the backend.
